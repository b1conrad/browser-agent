<p>Thank you for using <a href="https://b1conrad.github.io/browser-agent/spa.html">our code</a> for your browser agent.</p>
<h2 id="about-your-agent">About your agent</h2>
<h3 id="give-your-user-agent-a-name">Give your user agent a name</h3>
<p>You will be prompted for this as the page loads, which takes awhile, so thanks for your patience.
(If you wait too long, a random word will be used as the name. See instructions later for deleting that agent.)</p>
<h4 id="the-agent-page">The agent page</h4>
<p>Your agent has an agent page, allowing you to make connections.</p>
<p>This page has a link, &quot;links&quot; to its link page (beside the heading &quot;Connections&quot;).</p>
<h4 id="the-links-page">The links page</h4>
<p>Your agent has a link page, giving you direct links to your connected accounts.</p>
<p>This page has a link at the bottom, &quot;agent&quot; to return you to the agent page.</p>
<h3 id="the-inbound-router">The inbound router</h3>
<p>Use information provided to you out-of-band to configure your inbound router.
This is done on the agent page.
Afterwards, you can do everything else on the links page.</p>
<h2 id="a-story-line-for-practice">A story line for practice</h2>
<p>Other websites also have agents, which you can operate (on their behalf!).
You will do so as we progress through a sample story.</p>
