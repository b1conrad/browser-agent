# User Guide

Thank you for using [our code](https://b1conrad.github.io/browser-agent/spa.html) for your browser agent.

## About your agent

### Give your user agent a name

You will be prompted for this as the page loads, which takes awhile, so thanks for your patience.
(If you wait too long, a random word will be used as the name. See instructions later for deleting that agent.)

#### The agent page

Your agent has an agent page, allowing you to make connections.

This page has a link, "links" to its link page (beside the heading "Connections").

#### The links page

Your agent has a link page, giving you direct links to your connected accounts.

This page has a link at the bottom, "agent" to return you to the agent page.

### The inbound router

Use information provided to you out-of-band to configure your inbound router.
This is done on the agent page.
Afterwards, you can do everything else on the links page.

## A story line for practice

Other websites also have agents, which you can operate (on their behalf!).
You will do so as we progress through a sample story.
